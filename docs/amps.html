History
</p>

<p>
The Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) was an analog cellular mobile phone system developed by Bell Labs.
From 1968 to 1983 the Bell Labs worked out the system, while Motorola was developing the cellular phone.
Dr. Martin Cooper produced the first handheld phone "DynaTAC8000x", the famous Brick Phone.
</p>

<p>
AMPS was one of the first modern cellular phone systems, which remained in operation until 2008.
Service started in Chicago on October 13, 1983 and in the Washington, DC area December 1983.
After divestiture, AMPS was divided among the 7 newly created Regional Holding Companies, now known as RBOCs.

How it works
</p>

<p>
The detailed communication between base station and mobile station is described in <a href="TIA_EIA_553_A.compressed.pdf">TIA/EIA-553 standard</a>.
Click for reading the PDF file.
Thanks to TIA for allowing me to add the standard document to this project's documentation.

<p>
The idea a cellular network was to use clusters to re-use frequencies more ofter, so more calls can be made in one area.
As depicted, in a cluster with 7 cells (A to G), all cells must use different frequencies.
All frequencies can be re-used in surrounding clusters.
In the example, the G cell can use channel 4, 5 and 6 again in all other clusters, because their distance is far enough.
As depicted, the distance is 4.6 times the radius of a cell coverage.
To increase the number of calls using the same number of channels, the size of the cells have to be reduced.
Because cells getting smaller, hand-off is required when moving from one cell area to another.
A phone in a smaller cell must transmit with lower power than in large cells.
To keep track in which cell the phone currently located, a registration process tells the mobile switching office (MSO) where the phone can be reached in case of an incoming call.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Registering, power control and handoff are the key features of a cellular network.</font>
</p>

<p>
An AMPS network is divided into two systems, System A and System B.
Both systems have different radio channels.
System A was assigned to carriers that own no fixed network. (non-wireline)
System B was assigned to carriers that are phone companies with a fixed network. (wireline)
</p>

<p>
Each system has a system ID (SID).
A SID defines the home network.
If it does not match with the phone's SID, the phone will show 'ROAM', if not disabled.
If the SID is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), it belongs to System A.
If the SID is even (2, 4, 6, ...), it belongs to System B.
The System A or B or both can be selected on the phone.
</p>

<p>
To reduce radio noise, a syllabic compandor is used on both ends.
This compresses the audio level dynamics by 2.
An audio level of 25% is raised to 50% by the compressor and lowered to 25% by the expander.
A radio noise floor of 10% would be reduced to 1% by the expander.
</p>

<p>
The signaling is done with Manchester Code.
The symbol rate is 10,000 Hz, resulting in a frequency of 10 KHz.
To allow such high frequencies, the carrier frequency is directly shifted, instead of modulating two alternating tones.
</p>

<center><img src="amps-focc.png"/></center>

<p>
As depicted, each frame that is sent on the control channel of a base station,
starts with a dotting sequence (1010101...) to sync the receiver
and a sync word (11100010010) to indicate start of message.
Two words of 40 bits are repeated 5 times for redundancy.
An A-word belongs to mobiles with the last significant bit of their mobile identification number equals '1' and a B-word to mobiles with the last significant bit of their mobile identification number equals '0'.
Around sync and dotting and after every 10 bits of a message a B/I-bit is inserted, to indicate if the control channel is busy or not.
During an incoming message from a mobile phone, the base station will block the channels by setting the B/I-bit, so other mobile phone must wait until the channel is marked free again.
The bad news is, that the base station must react in less than 5 milliseconds, which is too fast for Osmocom-Analog.
The good news is, that this feature can be turned off.
</p>

<center><img src="amps-words.png"/></center>

<p>
This example shows two words that are used to call a mobile phone.
Each word consists of different bits, except for the last 12 bits.
They are used for parity check, resulting in 28 usable bit for the message itself.
Other words are used to broadcast cell info of the base station.
</p>

<center><img src="amps-recc.png"/></center>

<p>
The other direction is similar, but the size of the messages are different.
After dotting sequence and sync word, a digital color code (DCC) is used to prevent cells in surrounding clusters to receive the message from the mobile phone.
The size of each word is 48 bits.
These include the 36-bits-message and the 12 parity bits.
</p>

<center><img src="amps-fvc.png"/></center>

<p>
On a voice channel, the messages have even more redundancy, by repeating them 11 times.
</p>

<p>
Describing all messages with their function and their content is beyond the scope of this introduction.
Refer to the TIA specification, described above.

Setup of a base station
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Importaint: We need to connect to PLL and discriminator!</font>
</p>

<p>
AMPS does not use a modulated tone to carry bits of information, instead it modulates the radio carrier directly.
This image shows a signal generated by this software, which is similar to a received signal from the phone:
</p>

<center><img src="amps-burst.png"/></center>

<p>
Generally a receiver will do de-emphasis and filtering after demodulating the signal.
We don't want that.
It may work, but be sure to use a receiver with discriminator output.
This output gives direct signal of the frequency deviation of the received signal.
The signal on the sound card represents the frequency shift of the received signal.
Many receivers can be modified, so search the Web for more info.
</p>

<p>
On the transmitter we don't want to have filtering and pre-emphasis.
It may work, but be sure to use a transmitter that allows to disable emphasis.
I took the schematics of my transmitter and connected the sound card directly to the PLL.
The transmitter will now shift frequency according the the level of the sound card.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Importaint: We need to transmit correct polarity!</font>
</p>

<p>
In my case, my sound card is connected to a transmitter, where a positive sample value causes a negative frequency deviation.
This is why I need to flip the polarity of the signal, so I generate a negative sample value that causes a positive frequency deviation.
I use the '-F yes' option or '--flip-polarity yes'.
Also it is essential to use a transmitter with direct access to the modulator and and a receiver with direct access to the discriiminator.
I use '-p -d' or '--pre-emphasis --de-emphasis' to process emphasis for audio signal in software.
I use the calling channel (control channel) 334, which could also be used as traffic channel (voice channel).

</pre>

<p>
You should tune the receiver to 880.020 first, to check if you can hear and decode the idle signal from the base station.
Then tune to actually up-link frequency 835.020 MHz.
The actual level is not yet relevant.
(You may check the quality using '-l 2' or '--loopback 2' command line option and build a radio loop by tuning the receiver to the transmitter.)
</p>

<p>
If the polarity is correct and the volume of the signal (frequency deviation) is about right, you will make the phone register.
The phone will transmit on the up-link.
If not, try other polarity.
Also check if the phone allows to register on the selected system (A or B) and allowed to roam (any SID/AID).
This is how my phone registers to my network:

</pre>

<p>
After some time (several minutes), the phone re-registers, because a counter in the broadcast message is incremented.
This allows the mobile switching office (MSO) to check if the phone is still available.
Changing the SID will cause the phone to register instantaneously.
</p>

<p>
Level adjustment:
We see a receive level of around 93%.
This is already good, since I did the adjustment previously.
Tune your receiver to the up-link frequency, so you get loop-back of base station broadcast.
Run the software with "-l 2" option, so it will decode its own broadcast, if looped back through radios.
Use the variable resistor (connecting your transmitter) to adjust the volume until the received level matches the same level of your previously received message.
In my case I adjust the transmitter to match around 93%. (+- 10% is good)
Now, whatever frequency deviation the phone transmits for signaling, so does your transmitter.
Use the other variable resistor (connecting your receiver) to adjust the volume until the level matches about 100%. (+- 10% is good)
Switch back the receiver to up-link frequency and restart the phone.
</p>

<p>
To make a call from the mobile phone to the base station, just enter some digits at the mobile phone and press the dial button.
The phone requests an outgoing call on the reverse control channel (RECC), including identity and called number.
The base station will send an assignment to the mobile station on forward control channel (FOCC).
Then phone an base station switch to the voice channel.
In this case we have only defined one channel, so the control channel becomes a voice channel for the duration of the call.
All other phones will loose coverage during the call.
